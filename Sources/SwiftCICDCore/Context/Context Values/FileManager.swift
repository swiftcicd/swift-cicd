// From FileManager's documentation: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/filemanager :
// The methods of the shared FileManager object can be called from multiple threads safely. However, if you use a delegate to receive notifications about the status of move, copy,
// remove, and link operations, you should create a unique instance of the file manager object, assign your delegate to that object, and use that file manager to initiate your operations.
//
// That said â€” I'm not sure if the properties on FileManager are thread safe. I expect that FileMananger will eventually be made Sendable, or its replacement will.
